### âœ¨ Mechatronics Engineering Undergraduate
 ðŸ“« I am a mechatronics engineering undergraduate who is aiming to become a control systems engineer. I Always believe that strong theoretical background of the subject is what makes all of the advanced projects possible but I also know that practical knowledge is what concludes the project. I also believe that hands-on experience is the best method of learning, and because of that; I always try to reinforce what I learned by making mini-scale projects by himself. 
  
 ðŸ’¬ I'm a very curious individual whoâ€™s always try to grasp the intuition of the phenomena that heâ€™s encountering in my life.  
  
 ðŸ”­ I'm trying to learn the building blocks of modern technology and governing laws of the nature in the form of natural sciences. I enjoy researching natural sciences such as physics, mathematics, probability, and statistics, as well as information technologies such as computer science, data science, and digital electronics.
